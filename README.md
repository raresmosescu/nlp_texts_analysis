# nlp_texts_analysis
Analyze the text chats between people to uncover important insights about their relationship. What words do they use most often, what's the general sentiment, do they talk more casually or formal, etc.?

# Requirements
1. You need [`spacy`](https://spacy.io/usage) module installed 
2. You need a [language model](https://spacy.io/usage/models#languages) for the module. In the code I used `ro_core_news_sm` as I applied it on Romanian text. But you can change to whatever you want. 
If you want to use the same one, [this](https://spacy.io/models/ro#ro_core_news_sm) is the exact one I used.
